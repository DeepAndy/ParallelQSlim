\section*{Abstract}
This work elaborates a new parallel algorithm based on quadric error matric and adaptive thresholding to simplify a traingle mesh. The approach emphasises planar surface as a target to simplify. The main goal was to create a framework able to produce high quality progressive meshes for browser streaming purposes.
