Mesh simplification is necessary when one wants to reduce size of a mesh still preserving geometry. This project elaborates a specific case of mesh simplification where the focus is mostly on planar surfaces, like walls and floors, at the same time keeping high level of details for complex shapes; plants, elements on desks in an office, etc. Indoor mesh reconstruction introduces a problem of using the same level of details for the whole $3D$ space. Meaning, it uses the same resolution of faces for every SDF voxel. Most of planar surfaces can be described with reduced amount of trinagles. Therefore, after generating a reconstructed mesh from a point cloud we can successfully apply simplification with great results.
